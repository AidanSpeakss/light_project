# light_project
A new development project that I will be working on over this summer.

# Project Goal  
Create an alternative to the Flux integration with Phillips HUE Lights, that works for my cheaper, Tekkin smart lights, using a microcontroller and a small application on a rasberry pi. And have it controllable via any device on the same network, via a webpage.

# Why?  
In Febuary of this year I thought making my lights adjust with the time of the day could help me sleep better since my lights can keep me up. When I looked for ways to do this, they were either very expensive or required me to buy new smart lights. I already have Tekkin smart lights, so I researched ways to control them from another device without the app. And from my research this project was born. 

# Specifications  
I will be controlling my smart lights use the tutorial found here: https://lemariva.com/blog/2018/10/micropython-controlling-smart-power-outlets-using-an-esp32  
I am using a rasberry pi 3 and the same microcontrollers this article recommends.

# Steps to Create
- Step 1: Use my equipment to turn my lights on and off
- Step 2: Create an application that lets me turn the lights on and off through a website
- Step 3: Add an interface to change the brightness of a light.
- Step 4: Add an option to enables dynamic flux-like lighting and add an algorithm to do this.
- Step 5: Add a component that lets the user adjust the dynamic-lighting patern based on when they go to sleep and when they wake up.
- Step 6: Test, bugfixes, and polish.
